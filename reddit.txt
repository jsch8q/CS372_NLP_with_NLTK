A heteronym is a word that has the same spelling but a different meaning to another word. The following poem is taken from here
This tenor sang a lovely lied - but lied, And for that naughty deed, the lie, he died. For all his lies we loved the singer well - Now he lies toasted by the Singer's fires in Hell. They sow not neither shall they reap - A sow that farrows shall her piglets keep.

Most heteronyms are doubles. Triple heteronyms are extremely rare
Two examples, sin and mobile, are listed below. Proper nouns can sometimes be heteronyms. For example, the final syllable of [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_(disambiguation)) is pronounced like the word in by residents of that state in the United States, while in the name of the village of Oregon in Wisconsin, the final syllable is pronounced like the word on. Other examples include local pronunciations of Cairo, GA, Versailles, KY, and Milan, TN. There are also pairs which include both initialisms and regular words, e.g., US and us. [citation needed]

They're just different words, with completely different etymologies.
Because in English, the written characters have almost nothing to do with the way words are pronounced (video).
Do you know what a buck does to does?
Heteronyms can also occur in non-alphabetic languages. For example, the Chinese character 行 can be pronounced háng, meaning "profession", or xíng, meaning "OK".
"Heterophone" literally just means "different sound", and this term is sometimes applied to words that are just pronounced differently, irrespective of their spelling. Such a definition would obviously include virtually every pair of words in the language, so "heterophone" in this sense is normally restricted to instances where there is some particular reason to highlight the different sound. For example, puns normally involve homophones, but in the case of heterophonic (or imperfect) puns, the two words sound different, and yet similar enough for one to suggest the other (for example, mouth and mouse).

Actually, English is surprisingly consistent, phonetically, overall (estimates range around 85%). The problem is that the English language is comprised of over five source languages, and the pronunciation of a word depends on that source language. Of course that's not the case for all homophones and homographs, but it is the case for the vast majority.
In linguistics, a heteronym (also known as a heterophone) is a word that is written identically but has a different pronunciation and meaning. In other words, they are homographs that are not homophones. Thus, row (propel with oars) and row (argument) are heteronyms, but mean (intend) and mean (average) are not (since they are pronounced the same). Heteronym pronunciation may vary in vowel realisation, in stress pattern (see also Initial-stress-derived noun), or in other ways:
What makes the change in the way the " o " sound between bow ( as in take a bow) and bow ( as in bow and arrow)?

The wind was too strong to wind the sail.
If it weren't as consistent as it is, there would be no spelling bees, and kids wouldn't ask for language of origin. Of course, if it weren't for that 15% inconsistency, there'd be no point to a spelling bee, which is why they're really only fun in English.

Homonymic puns, another common type, arise from the exploitation of words which are both homographs and homophones. The statement "Being in politics is just like playing golf: you are trapped in one bad lie after another" puns on the two meanings of the word lie as "a deliberate untruth" and as "the position in which something rests". An adaptation of a joke repeated by Isaac Asimov gives us "Did you hear about the little moron who strained himself while running into the screen door?" playing on "strained" as "to give much effort" and "to filter".  A homonymic pun may also be polysemic, in which the words must be homonymic and also possess related meanings, a condition which is often subjective. However, lexicographers define polysemes as listed under a single dictionary [lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)) (a unique numbered meaning) while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata.
A recursive pun is one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first. For example the statement "π is only half a pie." (π radians is 180 degrees. Another example is "Infinity is not in finity", which means infinity is not in finite range. Another example is "A Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother."  Finally, we are given "Immanuel doesn't pun, he Kant" by Oscar Wilde [citation needed].
Italian waiter: "Sir! Are you sure you want the Scissor salad? You'll cut your mouth!"
"The Nail River" (The Nile River) in certain accents:
Never take your raft down the nail river. It'll pop instantly.
By any chance do you mean using the archaic sense of the word, rather than the modern definition of it?
Some words are homophones only if spoken in certain accents. Here are some examples of puns that depend on being pronounced in a particular accent:
Another type of visual pun exists in languages which use non-phonetic writing. For example, in Chinese, a pun may be based on a similarity in shape of the written character, despite a complete lack of phonetic similarity in the words punned upon.  Mark Elvin describes how this "peculiarly Chinese form of visual punning involved comparing written characters to objects".

Visual puns are used in many logos, emblems, insignia, and other graphic symbols, in which one or more of the pun aspects are replaced by a picture. In European heraldry, this technique is called canting arms. Visual and other puns and word games are also common in Dutch gable stones as well as in some cartoons, such as Lost Consonants and The Far Side.
What's the word for when I'm imposing the hereditary meanings of a word's roots upon the word?
A false etymology (pseudoetymology, paraetymology or paretymology), sometimes called folk etymology although this is also a technical term in linguistics, is a specious (plausible but false) belief about the origins of specific words, often originating in "common-sense" assumptions. Because of their specious "obviousness", many are widely held.
Not really. I'm thinking of something like "derivative" or "emergent" (with respect to the roots, of course).

Puns can be classified in various ways:
A homographic pun exploits words which are spelled the same (homographs) but possess different meanings and sounds. Because of their nature, they rely on sight more than hearing, contrary to homophonic puns. They are also known as heteronymic puns. Examples in which the punned words typically exist in two different parts of speech often rely on unusual sentence construction, as in the anecdote: "When asked to explain his large number of children, the pig answered simply: 'The wild oats of my sow gave us many piglets.' " An example which combines homophonic and homographic punning is Douglas Adams's line "You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish. Unless of course, you play bass." The phrase uses the homophonic qualities of "tune a" and "tuna", as well as the homographic pun on "bass", in which ambiguity is reached through the identical spellings of /ˈbeɪs/ (a string instrument), and /ˈbæs/ (a kind of fish.

Answer: To keep the Russians in Czech" relies on the aural ambiguity of the homophones "check" and "Czech". Often, puns are not strictly homophonic, but play on words of similar, not identical, sound as in the example from the "Pinky and the Brain" cartoon film series: "I think so, Brain, but if we give peas a chance, won't the lima beans feel left out?" which plays with the similar—but not identical—sound of "peas" and "peace".
"Space" (Spice) in certain accents:
"Caesar salad" (Scissor salad) in an Italian accent:
Such etymologies often have the feel of urban legends, and can be much more colorful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write sine nobilitate by their name, soon abbreviated to s.nob., hence the word snob).   Many recent examples are "backronyms" (acronyms made up to explain a term), as in "snob", and "posh" for "port outward, starboard homeward"
Many other sourced examples are listed in the article on backronyms.

Just to illustrate with a contrived example: suppose that I am a facetious person, and when I say "I am a gymnast", I'm jokingly referring to activities done sans clothing.
A compound pun is a statement that contains two or more puns. For example, a complex statement by Richard Whately includes four puns: "Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert? Because he can eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there? Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred."  This pun uses "sand which is there/sandwiches there", "[Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_(son_of_Noah))/ham", "mustered/mustard", and "bred/bread". Similarly, the phrase "Piano is not my Forte" cleverly links two meanings of the words "forte" and "piano", one for the dynamic markings in music and the second for the literal meaning of the sentence. Compound puns may also combine two phrases that share a word. For example, "Where do mathematicians go on weekends? To a Möbius strip club!" puns on Möbius strip and strip club.

Heteronyms are words spelled identically but with different meanings and pronunciations. There are lots of heteronyms in the English language. Since they have different pronunciation, you wouldn’t notice them in everyday speech.

If you’re like most people, that sentence looks wrong. After all, it has the same word repeated twice in a row. Most of us assume it can’t be proper grammar.
Did any of these sentences trip you up?

Heteronyms are a type of homograph, which is a set of words that have the same spelling but differ in meaning and sometimes in pronunciation.
Bruce M. Rowe and Diane P. Levin add, "Heteronyms are homographs that are not pronounced the same. The words tear (water in the eye) and tear (to rip) are heteronyms. Notice that the words homonym, homograph, homophone, and heteronym have overlapping meanings." ("A Concise Introduction to Linguistics," 4th ed. Routledge, 2016). Compare the above examples to the word dust. Dust would not be a heteronym. It functions as a verb and a noun, but it's pronounced the same way in both usages.
Heteronyms are not the same as homonyms, which have the same sound and spelling but different meanings. In contrast, homophones sound the same but are spelled differently. For additional examples, check out this list of " 200 Homonyms, Homophones, and Homographs" and a useful list of word-related terms, "Name That -nym."
The term heteronym has multiple definitions, depending on its usage referring to grammar, its use in linguistics, or its use in literature:
Thank you  for signing up.
When you're reading you just have to infer from the context of the text or the position of the word in the sentence (Is it being used as a verb or noun?) to understand which word is meant.

Capitonym is not a word that you will find in the dictionary, but it has been used to describe words that change their pronunciation and meaning when capitalized. They are thus a form of heteronym. Here is a selection of capitonyms, complete with brief definitions:
Seat: Car manufacturer
Seat: Chair.

Capitonyms are not really True Heteronyms for two reasons. First, the capitalised forms are proper nouns, and as such may not be found in standard dictionaries. Second, a pair of heteronyms must be spelled identically. It is arguable that there is a graphological difference between a word that must be capitalized and one that must not.

As has been said, there are many heteronyms in the English language, and there is not space for a comprehensive list here. The list below is a selection of the words that, whilst sharing a spelling, have unique pronunciations and unique meanings.
Degas: French painter and sculptor
Degas: To remove gas.

Said: Egyptian port
Said: Spoken.
Do you notice anything about the pairs above? In every case one of the heteronyms is a noun and the other is a verb. In most cases, the difference in pronunciation is simply a matter of stress or emphasis. In fact, a deeper pattern emerges if you study which of the syllables are stressed in these sentences. Look at the two-syllable words and you will see that in almost every case the noun is stressed on the first syllable, and the verb is stressed on the second (e.g. noun: CON-test
Verb: con-TEST).
True Heteronyms
Axes: plural of ax (US spelling) or axe (British spelling)

These Grammatical Function Heteronyms have been separated from so-called True Heteronyms because heteronyms must differ in meaning. In these cases where the only notable difference is their category of speech, you could argue that their meanings are not that different at all.

Occasionally foreign words accepted into use in English retain their diacritical marks (accents). However, as English does not make use of diacritical marks, it is generally considered acceptable to omit them. If the adopted word is spelled the same as an existing English word, but pronounced differently, then a heteronym is born. Here are a few examples:
When I graduate I will become a graduate.
Slough: A borough in England
Slough: Dead skin of reptile.

Very often in English words are used in more than one part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).Take the word dust, for example. If you dust the bedroom, you are removing the dust. In its first occurrence here, dust is a verb meaning to clean
The second dust is a noun meaning the stuff being cleaned away. Dust in not a heteronym, however, because both forms of the word are pronounced identically. Often, though, this is not the case
When the two words differ in sound, they form a pair of heteronyms.
