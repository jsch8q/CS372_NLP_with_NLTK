Similarly, defense is stressed on the first syllable when talking about sports (not just football). But it's on the second syllable outside of sports (national defense).
In American football, the stress is always on the first syllable of offensive (offensive lineman, offensive pass interference).
I've never heard the second pronunciation but maybe it's related to how people stress the first syllable in offense and defence (as opposed to the second syllable)?
You may also put dots between the syllables

"Heterophone" literally just means "different sound", and this term is sometimes applied to words that are just pronounced differently, irrespective of their spelling. Such a definition would obviously include virtually every pair of words in the language, so "heterophone" in this sense is normally restricted to instances where there is some particular reason to highlight the different sound. For example, puns normally involve homophones, but in the case of heterophonic (or imperfect) puns, the two words sound different, and yet similar enough for one to suggest the other (for example, mouth and mouse).
What makes the change in the way the " o " sound between bow ( as in take a bow) and bow ( as in bow and arrow)?

Very often in English words are used in more than one part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).Take the word dust, for example. If you dust the bedroom, you are removing the dust. In its first occurrence here, dust is a verb meaning to clean
The second dust is a noun meaning the stuff being cleaned away. Dust in not a heteronym, however, because both forms of the word are pronounced identically. Often, though, this is not the case
When the two words differ in sound, they form a pair of heteronyms.

Occasionally foreign words accepted into use in English retain their diacritical marks (accents). However, as English does not make use of diacritical marks, it is generally considered acceptable to omit them. If the adopted word is spelled the same as an existing English word, but pronounced differently, then a heteronym is born. Here are a few examples
The button was so minute that it was a minute before I found it.
Please put my typewriter to use because I never use it.

Capitonyms are not really True Heteronyms for two reasons. First, the capitalised forms are proper nouns, and as such may not be found in standard dictionaries. Second, a pair of heteronyms must be spelled identically. It is arguable that there is a graphological difference between a word that must be capitalized and one that must not.
